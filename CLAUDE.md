# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes The Graph's indexed blockchain data to AI agents. Built with Python's FastMCP framework, it provides three tools: `searchSubgraphs` (find subgraphs by name/description), `getSubgraphSchema` (introspect a subgraph's GraphQL schema), and `querySubgraph` (execute arbitrary GraphQL queries against a subgraph).

## Commands

```bash
# Run the MCP server
uv run main.py

# Install/sync dependencies
uv sync
```

There is no test suite or linter configured.

## Architecture

The entire server lives in `main.py` (~115 lines):

- **FastMCP server** instance exposes tools via `@mcp.tool()` decorators
- **`searchSubgraphs(searchQuery)`** — uses the Network Subgraph's `subgraphMetadataSearch` full-text search to find subgraphs by name/description. Returns a concise list of subgraph IDs, display names, networks, and signal amounts. Filters out inactive subgraphs (no current version).
- **`getSubgraphSchema(subgraphId, asText)`** — fetches a subgraph's schema via GraphQL introspection. When `asText=True`, the helper `json_to_graphql_schema()` converts the JSON introspection result into human-readable GraphQL SDL.
- **`querySubgraph(subgraphId, query)`** — posts an arbitrary GraphQL query to The Graph gateway and returns the JSON response.
- All API calls go through `httpx.AsyncClient` to `https://gateway.thegraph.com/api/{API_KEY}/subgraphs/id/{subgraphId}` with a 10-second timeout.
- Authentication is via the `THEGRAPH_API_KEY` environment variable (loaded from `.env` by python-dotenv).

## Dependencies

Managed by **uv** (lock file: `uv.lock`). Python >=3.13 required.

- `mcp[cli]` — MCP server framework
- `httpx` — async HTTP client
- `dotenv` — .env file loading
